# User Guide for Intelligent Event Management System

This guide will help you understand how to use the Intelligent Event Management System. The system is designed to automate event scheduling, analyze attendee engagement, process real-time feedback, and provide an interactive dashboard for insights.

## Automated Event Scheduling

The system uses Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine to schedule events based on user preferences and historical data. 

To schedule events, use the `schedule_events` function in `event_scheduling/scheduling_logic.py`:

```python
from event_scheduling.scheduling_logic import schedule_events

user_preferences = [...]  # User preferences
historical_data = [...]  # Historical data

scheduled_events = schedule_events(user_preferences, historical_data)
```

To update the model with new data, use the `update_model` function:

```python
from event_scheduling.scheduling_logic import update_model

new_data = [...]  # New data

update_model(new_data)
```

## Attendee Analysis

The system uses Google Cloud Vision API and Speech-to-Text API to analyze attendee demographics and engagement.

To analyze an attendee, use the `analyze_attendee` function in `attendee_analysis/analysis_logic.py`:

```python
from attendee_analysis.analysis_logic import analyze_attendee

image_path = 'path_to_image'  # Path to the image file
speech_file_path = 'path_to_speech'  # Path to the audio file

analysis_result = analyze_attendee(image_path, speech_file_path)
```

## Real-Time Feedback Processing

The system uses Google Cloud Natural Language API to process and analyze real-time feedback from attendees.

To analyze feedback, use the `analyze_feedback` function in `feedback_processing/natural_language_api.py`:

```python
from feedback_processing.natural_language_api import analyze_feedback

feedback_text = 'feedback_text'  # Feedback text

analysis_result = analyze_feedback(feedback_text)
```

## Interactive Dashboard

The dashboard provides insights from the event, such as attendee engagement, sentiment analysis, and topic trends. You can access the dashboard by opening `dashboard/ui.html` in your web browser.

## Security and Compliance

The system ensures data privacy and security, complying with relevant regulations. For more information, refer to `security_and_compliance/security_measures.py` and `security_and_compliance/data_handling.py`.

## Data Storage

The system uses Google Cloud Storage for data storage and management. For more information, refer to `data_storage/storage_management.py`.

## Testing and Validation

The system includes comprehensive tests to ensure functionality. To run the tests, use the following commands:

```python
python -m unittest testing_and_validation.unit_tests
python -m unittest testing_and_validation.user_acceptance_tests
```
