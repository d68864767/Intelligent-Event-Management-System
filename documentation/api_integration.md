# API Integration Documentation

This document provides a detailed guide on how the various Google Cloud APIs are integrated into the Intelligent Event Management System.

## Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine

The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine is used for automated event scheduling. The model is trained with historical data and user preferences to predict the best time for an event. The model is defined and trained in `event_scheduling/model.ml` and the scheduling logic is implemented in `event_scheduling/scheduling_logic.py`.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from google.cloud import automl_v1beta1 as automl
from google.cloud.automl_v1beta1.proto import service_pb2

# Define Google Cloud project and model details
project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
compute_region = 'YOUR_COMPUTE_REGION'
model_id = 'YOUR_MODEL_ID'

# Initialize the client for AutoML
client = automl.AutoMlClient()

# Get the full path of the model
model_full_id = client.model_path(project_id, compute_region, model_id)

# Get the model details
response = client.get_model(model_full_id)

# Print out the model details
print("Model display name: {}".format(response.display_name))
print("Model dataset id: {}".format(response.dataset_id))
print("Model create time:")
print("\tseconds: {}".format(response.create_time.seconds))
print("\tnanos: {}".format(response.create_time.nanos))
print("Model deployment state: {}".format(response.deployment_state))

# Define your training data
training_data = [
    # Add your training data here
]

# Train the model
print("Training model...")
model = client.model_service.train_model(model_full_id, training_data)
print("Model trained.")

# Use the model to make predictions
print("Making predictions...")
predictions = model.predict(training_data)
print("Predictions: ", predictions)
```

## Google Cloud Vision API

The Google Cloud Vision API is used for attendee analysis. It analyzes images captured during the event to determine attendee demographics and engagement. The image analysis is done in `attendee_analysis/vision_api.py`.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from google.cloud import vision
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict

def analyze_image(image_path):
    """
    Function to analyze image using Google Cloud Vision API
    :param image_path: Path to the image file
    :return: Analyzed image data in dictionary format
    """
    # Initialize a client for Vision API
    client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()

    # Load image from path
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
        content = image_file.read()

    image = vision.Image(content=content)

    # Perform face detection on the image file
    response = client.face_detection(image=image)

    # Convert the response to dictionary format
    analyzed_data = MessageToDict(response)

    return analyzed_data
```

## Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API

The Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API is used to transcribe speeches or presentations during the event. The transcriptions are used for content analysis. The speech transcription is done in `attendee_analysis/speech_to_text_api.py`.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from google.cloud import speech_v1p1beta1 as speech
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict

def transcribe_speech(speech_file_path):
    """
    Function to transcribe speech using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
    :param speech_file_path: Path to the audio file
    :return: Transcribed text data in dictionary format
    """
    # Initialize a client for Speech-to-Text API
    client = speech.SpeechClient()

    # Load audio from path
    with open(speech_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
        content = audio_file.read()

    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=content)

    # Configure the recognition process
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code="en-US",
    )
```

## Google Cloud Natural Language API

The Google Cloud Natural Language API is used to process and analyze real-time feedback from attendees. It identifies the overall sentiment and key topics of interest. The feedback processing is done in `feedback_processing/natural_language_api.py`.

```python
# Import the Google Cloud client library
from google.cloud import language_v1
from google.cloud.language_v1 import enums

def analyze_feedback(feedback_text):
    """
    Analyzing Sentiment in a String

    Args:
    feedback_text The text content to analyze
    """
    client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()

    # Available types: PLAIN_TEXT, HTML
    type_ = enums.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT
```

## Google App Engine

The Google App Engine is used to host the interactive dashboard. The dashboard displays insights from the event, such as attendee engagement, sentiment analysis, and topic trends. The dashboard logic is implemented in `dashboard/dashboard_logic.py`.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from flask import Flask, render_template
from google.cloud import storage
from event_scheduling.scheduling_logic import schedule_events
from attendee_analysis.analysis_logic import analyze_attendee
```

## Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage is used for data storage and management. It stores the event data, model data, and other necessary data for the system. The storage management is done in `data_storage/storage_management.py`.
