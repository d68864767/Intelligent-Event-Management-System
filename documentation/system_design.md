# Intelligent Event Management System - System Design

## Overview
The Intelligent Event Management System is a cloud-based solution that leverages Google Cloud APIs to offer features like automated event scheduling, attendee analysis, and real-time feedback processing. The system is designed to harness the power of Google Cloud's AI capabilities to solve real-world problems in event management.

## System Architecture

### Automated Event Scheduling
The event scheduling module uses Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine to schedule events based on user preferences and historical data. The model is trained with historical data and user preferences to predict the best time for an event. The model and scheduling logic are implemented in `event_scheduling/model.ml` and `event_scheduling/scheduling_logic.py` respectively.

### Attendee Analysis
The attendee analysis module uses Google Cloud Vision API and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to analyze attendee demographics and engagement during events. The Vision API is used to analyze images of attendees to extract demographic information, while the Speech-to-Text API is used to transcribe speeches or presentations for content analysis. The image analysis, speech transcription, and analysis logic are implemented in `attendee_analysis/vision_api.py`, `attendee_analysis/speech_to_text_api.py`, and `attendee_analysis/analysis_logic.py` respectively.

### Real-Time Feedback Processing
The feedback processing module uses Google Cloud Natural Language API to process and analyze real-time feedback from attendees, identifying overall sentiment and key topics of interest. The Natural Language API and processing logic are implemented in `feedback_processing/natural_language_api.py` and `feedback_processing/processing_logic.py` respectively.

### Interactive Dashboard
The interactive dashboard is developed using Google App Engine and is designed to display insights from the event, such as attendee engagement, sentiment analysis, and topic trends. The dashboard logic and user interface are implemented in `dashboard/dashboard_logic.py`, `dashboard/ui.html`, `dashboard/ui.css`, and `dashboard/ui.js`.

### Security and Compliance
The system ensures data privacy and security, complying with relevant regulations. The security measures and data handling are implemented in `security_and_compliance/security_measures.py` and `security_and_compliance/data_handling.py`.

### Data Storage
The system uses Google Cloud Storage for data storage and management. The storage management is implemented in `data_storage/storage_management.py`.

## Testing and Validation
The system includes comprehensive tests to ensure functionality, including unit tests and user acceptance testing. The tests are implemented in `testing_and_validation/unit_tests.py` and `testing_and_validation/user_acceptance_tests.py`.

## Documentation
The system includes detailed documentation on system design, API integration, and user guides. The documentation is located in `documentation/system_design.md`, `documentation/api_integration.md`, and `documentation/user_guides.md`.
